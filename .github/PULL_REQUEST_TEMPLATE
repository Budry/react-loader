#### What does this PR do?
Adds a demo.

#### Where should the reviewer start?
Open demo/index.html in a browser - no `npm install` or other build steps necessary.

#### How should this be manually tested?
You can restart the demo with the reload button. The button should be disabled while loading, and the loader should load in 1500ms.

#### Any background context you want to provide?
React, ReactDOM, Spin.JS, and a Babel compiler all reference a CDN to avoid any build process for the demo. The Babel compiler was necessary for JSX syntax (wanted to stay consistent with the README).

Also updated the README with a mention of the demo and a gif.

#### What are the relevant issues (if any)?
#23

#### Screenshots (if appropriate)

#### Obligatory GIF
